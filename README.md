This **E-commerce** application allows clients to Sign Up for the App. Once the client logs in successfully, a list of buyable items shows, and the client can choose which one to buy.
Clients can at any time see all the bought items, the total price of the bought products, and the purchase status of the order.
The client can also remove a product from **Cart**.

To run the client side of the App, change the working directory to point to the **frontend** folder of the app and run `npm start`.
To run the App server, change the working directory to point to the **backend** folder, and run `npm start`. For this project, I used a docker image  to initialize the DB, 
so if you don't want to use it, use the MongoDB Atlas cluster to connect the DB.
