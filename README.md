# Fullstack_TS_Chat_App
 
This **Chat_App** application allows clients to Sign Up for the App. Once the client **logs in successfully**, Users can take part in the Chat.

To run the client side of the App, change the working directory to point to the **frontend** folder of the app and run `npm start`.
To run the App server, change the working directory to point to the **backend** folder, and run `npm start`. For this project, I used a docker image  to initialize the DB, 
so if you don't want to use it, use the [MongoDB Atlas cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/connect-to-your-cluster/) to connect the DB.
